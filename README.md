## Overview

This repository is a public collection of my ESPHome device configurations. It is intended for educational, reference, and practical use. All sensitive information (such as WiFi credentials and API keys) is stored in `secrets.yaml` and not included in the repository.

Some configurations are based on or inspired by awesome projects from the community (see [Credits & Inspirations](#credits--inspirations)).

## Development Setup

### IDE Setup

For the best development experience, I recommend using Visual Studio Code or Cursor with the following extensions:

1. [ESPHome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ESPHome.esphome-vscode) - Provides YAML validation, syntax highlighting, and device management
2. [ESPHome Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ESPHome.esphome-snippets) - Adds useful code snippets for ESPHome development

### Local ESPHome CLI

To validate configurations and perform OTA updates locally, you'll need to install the ESPHome CLI. Here's how to set it up on Linux with installed Python:

1. Install ESPHome CLI using pip:
```bash
pip3 install esphome
```

2. Update ESPHome CLI when new versions are released:
```bash
pip3 install -U esphome
```

or

```bash
pip3 install esphome --upgrade
```

3. Validate a configuration:
```bash
esphome validate your-config.yaml
```

4. Perform an OTA update:
```bash
esphome run your-config.yaml
```

For more detailed installation and update instructions, refer to the official ESPHome documentation:
- [Getting Started Guide](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line)
- [Installation Guide](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome)
