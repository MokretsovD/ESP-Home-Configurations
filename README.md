## Overview

This repository is a public collection of my ESPHome device configurations. It is intended for educational, reference, and practical use. All sensitive information (such as WiFi credentials and API keys) is stored in `secrets.yaml` and not included in the repository.

Some configurations are based on or inspired by awesome projects from the community (see [Credits & Inspirations](#credits--inspirations)).
