## 2. Product Structure

The M14 communicates with external devices via a data connector and flexible cable. Key structural parameters are as follows:

### 2.1 Product Appearance

_(Illustration not included)_

### 2.2 Product Dimensions

- Width: 21mm
- Height: 15mm
- Depth: 12.2mm
- Thickness: 2mm

### 2.3 Data Connector

- 12-pin connector
- Pitch: 0.50mm
- Pin layout and spacing detailed in schematic

### 2.4 Flexible Cable

- FFC/FPC thickness: 0.30 ± 0.03 mm
- Contact spacing: 0.5 ± 0.05 mm

### 2.5 Structural Design Considerations

#### 2.5.1 Component Layout

- Ensure sufficient space to avoid pressure or contact with M14 electronics
- Allow room for flexible cable to return to its natural shape without compression

#### 2.5.2 Temperature Management

- Avoid insulating materials like rubber around the M14 casing
- Consider adding heat dissipation components if possible

#### 2.5.3 Reading Window

- Must protect the camera, focus light, and illumination light
- Guidelines:
  - Opaque areas must not block lights or camera
  - Use high-transparency, wear-resistant materials (e.g., dual-sided hard-coated glass)
  - Glass should be parallel to lens and perpendicular to front panel, within 2mm distance
  - If tilted, glass must be >5mm away and angled to prevent light reflection into lens

## 4. Software Design

The M14 supports a rich command set for communication. The host system can use these commands to configure the device, query status, and initiate barcode reading.  
Refer to the software reference design and the protocol document titled **"Barcode Reader Communication Programming 1.0"** for implementation details.
